This is Fairy Lisp, an interpreter for an experimental Lisp dialect.

I wanted to explore various ideas, like modules, first-class macros (and making
the two work together without problems), first-class namespaces, and more.

(Details follow later... Yes, there is a lot missing and wrong with it, it's a
work in progress.)


Requirements:

* D compiler (I am currently using dmd 2.075.0 for macOS, via Homebrew)
